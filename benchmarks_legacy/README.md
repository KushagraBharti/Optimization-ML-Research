## Legacy Benchmarks

This folder contains heuristic-only benchmarking scripts kept for historical reference. They exercise the non-paper-faithful solvers from coverage_planning.algs.heuristics and are not used in the data or learning pipelines.

Prefer the reference benchmarks under ../benchmarks/ for current profiling.
